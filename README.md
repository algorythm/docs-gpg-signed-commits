# Signing commits with GPG (PGP)

This repository contains documentation on how to get PGP signing working when committing code

## GPG keys

*Please note* that all guides contain information about how to generate new GPG keys - please note though, that if you have multiple machines you should only create 1 new keypair, and then you should export the keys and import the key on your other machine.

This procedure is currently not documented.

## macOS
